# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised learning techniques. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (Credit_Card_Fraud.ipynb) that walks through data preparation, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.

# Project Overview

Financial institutions face large losses due to fraudulent card transactions. This project provides a reproducible pipeline to:

**1.Explore and preprocess a credit card transactions dataset.**

**2.Train several classification models to separate legitimate transactions from fraud.**

**3.Evaluate models using metrics appropriate for imbalanced data (precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).**

**4.Compare results and recommend the best-performing approach.**

The notebook is designed for learning, experimentation, and as a template you can extend with your own data or feature engineering.
